# Summary: Admin Subdomain Routing Implementation

## Date: 6 octobre 2025

## Changes Made

### 1. Documentation Updates

#### `.github/copilot-instructions.md` ✅
- Added Business Context section with subdomain routing details
- Added Security & Environment Variables section
- Updated Middleware Protection section with subdomain routing info
- Added `lib/supabase/admin.ts` to Key Files
- Added weekly credit reset cron job reference
- Documented email service status (planned post-dev)

#### `docs/PRD/PRD_ADMIN_SUBDOMAIN_ROUTING.md` ✅
- Created comprehensive PRD for subdomain routing feature
- Documented complete implementation plan
- Added testing strategy
- Included rollout plan and monitoring

#### `DEPLOYMENT.md` ✅
- Added subdomain DNS configuration guide
- Updated environment variables section
- Added Supabase OAuth redirect URLs configuration
- Included subdomain testing commands

#### `.env.example` ✅
- Created new file with all required environment variables
- Added comments for server-only vs public variables
- Documented subdomain URLs for production and development

### 2. Code Implementation

#### `app/auth/callback/page.tsx` ✅
- Added role-based redirect logic after authentication
- Admin users → redirect to `NEXT_PUBLIC_ADMIN_URL` (gestion.domain)
- Regular users → redirect to `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` (app.domain)
- Fallback to `/dashboard` if env vars not configured (local dev)

#### `middleware.ts` ✅
- Added `extractRootDomain()` helper function
- Implemented subdomain detection logic
- Added role-based subdomain routing (production only)
- Updated cookie configuration to share cookies across subdomains
- Admin on app.domain → redirect to gestion.domain
- Regular user on gestion.domain → redirect to app.domain
- Added logging with `[v0]` prefix for debugging

#### `lib/config/cors.ts` ✅
- Added `NEXT_PUBLIC_ADMIN_URL` to allowed origins
- Ensures CORS works for both app and admin subdomains

### 3. Environment Variables

**New Required Variables:**
```bash
# Main app domain (users)
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=https://app.ninowash.com

# Admin subdomain
NEXT_PUBLIC_ADMIN_URL=https://gestion.ninowash.com
```

**Development:**
```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=http://localhost:3000
NEXT_PUBLIC_ADMIN_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

### 4. Security Improvements

✅ **NO environment variables are publicly exposed**
- All sensitive keys (Stripe secret, Supabase service role) are server-only
- Only `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` variables are exposed to client
- Admin client (`createAdminClient()`) only used in webhooks/cron jobs

✅ **Cookie Security**
- Shared across subdomains in production (`.domain.com`)
- `httpOnly`, `secure`, `sameSite` flags maintained
- Separate domains for admin and user interfaces

✅ **Subdomain Isolation**
- Admin interface isolated on separate subdomain
- Automatic role-based redirects prevent unauthorized access
- Works with existing RLS policies

### 5. Features Status

| Feature | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| Subdomain routing | ✅ Implemented | Production-only, falls back to path-based in dev |
| Auth redirect by role | ✅ Implemented | Admin → gestion.domain, User → app.domain |
| Cookie sharing | ✅ Implemented | Cookies shared across subdomains in production |
| CORS configuration | ✅ Updated | Both subdomains allowed |
| Environment variables | ✅ Documented | `.env.example` created |
| DNS configuration guide | ✅ Documented | Added to DEPLOYMENT.md |
| Weekly credit reset | ✅ Exists | Already implemented via cron job |
| Email service | ⏳ Planned | Post-dev phase |

### 6. Testing Checklist

**Before deploying to production:**
- [ ] Configure DNS records for `app.domain` and `gestion.domain`
- [ ] Add both subdomains in Vercel project settings
- [ ] Set environment variables in Vercel dashboard
- [ ] Add both callback URLs in Supabase Auth settings
- [ ] Test login as regular user → should redirect to `app.domain`
- [ ] Test login as admin → should redirect to `gestion.domain`
- [ ] Test cookie persistence across subdomains
- [ ] Test CORS for API calls from both subdomains
- [ ] Monitor logs for redirect loops

**Development testing:**
- [ ] Verify subdomain routing is disabled in dev (localhost)
- [ ] Verify auth redirects work without env vars (fallback to `/dashboard`)
- [ ] Test both user and admin flows locally

### 7. Deployment Steps

1. **DNS Configuration** (via domain registrar)
   ```
   app.ninowash.com → CNAME → cname.vercel-dns.com
   gestion.ninowash.com → CNAME → cname.vercel-dns.com
   ```

2. **Vercel Configuration**
   - Add both domains in Project Settings → Domains
   - Wait for DNS propagation (~5-15 minutes)
   - Verify SSL certificates are issued

3. **Environment Variables** (Vercel Dashboard)
   ```bash
   NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=https://app.ninowash.com
   NEXT_PUBLIC_ADMIN_URL=https://gestion.ninowash.com
   ```

4. **Supabase Configuration**
   - Add redirect URLs:
     - `https://app.ninowash.com/auth/callback`
     - `https://gestion.ninowash.com/auth/callback`
   - Set Site URL: `https://app.ninowash.com`

5. **Deploy & Monitor**
   - Push to production branch
   - Monitor Vercel logs for redirect issues
   - Test auth flow for both user types
   - Check cookie sharing works

### 8. Rollback Plan

If subdomain routing causes issues:
1. Remove subdomain env vars from Vercel
2. Auth will fall back to path-based routing (`/admin`, `/dashboard`)
3. Middleware will skip subdomain logic (env vars not set)
4. Existing functionality preserved

### 9. Next Steps

- [ ] Test in staging environment with preview URLs
- [ ] Configure production DNS records
- [ ] Deploy and monitor
- [ ] Update user documentation with new URLs
- [ ] Consider adding automatic subdomain detection in login form

## Architecture Decision Record

**Decision**: Implement subdomain-based routing for admin interface

**Context**:
- Better separation of concerns between user and admin interfaces
- Enhanced security through domain isolation
- Improved user experience with distinct URLs
- Easier to manage sessions and CORS policies

**Consequences**:
- ✅ Clearer distinction between user and admin areas
- ✅ Better security posture
- ✅ Easier to scale (can host on separate infrastructure later)
- ⚠️ Requires DNS configuration and dual-domain SSL
- ⚠️ Cookie sharing must be properly configured
- ⚠️ More complex testing (multiple domains)

**Alternatives Considered**:
1. Path-based routing (`/admin`) - Simpler but less isolated
2. Separate deployments - More complex, higher cost
3. Subdomain routing - **Chosen** - Good balance of isolation and simplicity
