## Rollback Procedures

### If Payment System Has Issues

**Option 1: Immediate Rollback (Fastest)**
```bash
# Revert to previous deployed version
git revert HEAD
git push origin main
# Redeploy (auto-deploy if enabled)
```

**Option 2: Keep Data, Fix Code**
```bash
# Fix the issue in code
git add .
git commit -m "fix: payment issue"
git push origin main
# Redeploy
```

**Option 3: Disable Webhook (Last Resort)**
- Delete webhook endpoint from Stripe Dashboard
- This prevents webhook errors but payments still work
- Re-enable after fix is deployed

### If Database Migration Has Issues

**Option 1: Rollback Migration**
```sql
-- In Supabase SQL Editor, run the reverse migration
-- (provided in migration file comments)
```

**Option 2: From Backup**
- Go to Supabase ‚Üí Backups
- Restore from before migration
- Re-apply migration after fix
