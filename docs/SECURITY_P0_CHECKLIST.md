# Sprint P0 - Security Immediate - Completion Checklist

## Overview
This document tracks the completion status of Sprint P0 security requirements as defined in the PRD.

## Completed Items

### 1. Database Viewer Removal
- [x] `/database-viewer` route returns 404 with security message
- [x] No database inspection capabilities exposed publicly
- [x] Verified in `app/database-viewer/page.tsx`

### 2. Health Check Lockdown
- [x] `/api/health` returns minimal `{ "status": "ok" }` response
- [x] `/api/health/auth` simplified to minimal response
- [x] `/api/health/db` simplified to minimal response
- [x] `/api/health/stripe` simplified to minimal response
- [x] No infrastructure details leaked (version, memory, uptime removed)

### 3. Service Role Key Protection
- [x] Service role key only used in server-side code
- [x] `lib/supabase/admin.ts` properly isolates admin client
- [x] No client-side references to service role key found
- [x] Verified via grep search - 0 matches in client code

### 4. Admin Guard Implementation
- [x] Created `lib/auth/admin-guard.ts` with `requireAdmin()` function
- [x] Server-side validation of admin role from JWT
- [x] Checks both `user_metadata.role` and `app_metadata.role`
- [x] Redirects non-admin users to home page
- [x] Includes `isAdmin()` helper for conditional checks
- [x] Integrated into `app/admin/layout.tsx`

### 5. Middleware Enhancement
- [x] Admin route protection enforced at middleware level
- [x] Checks both `user_metadata.role` and `app_metadata.role`
- [x] Enhanced security headers added:
  - [x] `X-Frame-Options: DENY`
  - [x] `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`
  - [x] `Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin`
  - [x] `Permissions-Policy: camera=(), microphone=(), geolocation=()`
  - [x] `Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains; preload`
  - [x] `X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block`

## Security Validation

### Access Control Tests
- [ ] TODO: Test non-admin user accessing `/admin/*` routes (should redirect to `/`)
- [ ] TODO: Test admin user accessing `/admin/*` routes (should succeed)
- [ ] TODO: Test unauthenticated user accessing `/admin/*` routes (should redirect to `/`)

### Key Rotation (Manual Step Required)
- [ ] TODO: Rotate Supabase service role key in Supabase dashboard
- [ ] TODO: Update `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` in Vercel environment variables
- [ ] TODO: Rotate Supabase anon key in Supabase dashboard
- [ ] TODO: Update `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` in Vercel environment variables
- [ ] TODO: Verify all server-side functions still work after rotation

### Bundle Analysis
- [ ] TODO: Run bundle analyzer to confirm no service role key in client bundle
- [ ] TODO: Verify no Supabase admin client code in client bundle

### Penetration Testing
- [ ] TODO: Attempt to access database viewer (should return 404)
- [ ] TODO: Attempt to access health checks (should return minimal data only)
- [ ] TODO: Attempt privilege escalation on admin routes
- [ ] TODO: Verify RLS policies prevent unauthorized data access

## Acceptance Criteria Status

From PRD Sprint P0:

- [x] `database-viewer` returns 404
- [x] No client bundle includes service-role key (verified via grep)
- [x] `/healthz` returns minimal JSON
- [x] Admin endpoints reject non-admins (middleware + SSR guard)
- [ ] Keys rotated & stored server-side only (MANUAL STEP REQUIRED)

## Next Steps

1. **Manual Key Rotation**: Follow the key rotation procedure in production
2. **Testing**: Run the security validation tests listed above
3. **Monitoring**: Set up alerts for:
   - Failed admin access attempts (403s on `/admin/*`)
   - Unusual patterns in health check requests
   - Any attempts to access removed routes

## Notes

- All code changes are complete and deployed
- Key rotation is a manual operational step that must be performed by DevOps/Security team
- RLS policies should be reviewed separately to ensure alignment with admin guards
- Consider adding automated security scanning to CI/CD pipeline

## Sign-off

- [ ] Tech Lead Review
- [ ] Security Team Review
- [ ] QA Validation Complete
- [ ] Production Deployment Approved
