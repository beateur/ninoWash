# Sprint P0: Security Immediate - Completion Checklist

## Completed Items

### 1. Database Viewer Removal
- [x] Deleted `/app/database-viewer/page.tsx`
- [x] Added 410 Gone response in middleware for `/database-viewer` route
- [x] Added permanent redirect in next.config.mjs

### 2. Health Check Lockdown
- [x] Updated `/api/health` to return minimal response: `{ "status": "ok" }`
- [x] Removed infrastructure details (uptime, memory, version, environment)

### 3. Admin Guard Implementation
- [x] Created `lib/middleware/admin-guard.ts` with server-side role verification
- [x] Applied admin guard to `/api/admin/stats` endpoint
- [x] Logs all unauthorized access attempts with timestamp and user info

### 4. Security Headers Enhancement
- [x] Added HSTS with preload (1 year)
- [x] Enhanced CSP with strict policies
- [x] Added Permissions-Policy to deny camera/mic/geolocation
- [x] Configured headers in both middleware.ts and next.config.mjs

### 5. Session Management
- [x] Middleware refreshes sessions for authenticated routes
- [x] Auto-redirect to signin for unauthenticated users on protected routes
- [x] Uses HttpOnly cookies via Supabase SSR

## Remaining P0 Tasks (Manual)

### Key Rotation (DevOps/Security Team)
- [ ] Rotate Supabase anon key
- [ ] Rotate Supabase service-role key (if exposed)
- [ ] Update environment variables in Vercel/deployment platform
- [ ] Verify no service-role key in client bundle (run bundle analyzer)

### RLS Policy Verification (Database Team)
- [ ] Verify RLS policies align with admin role checks
- [ ] Test admin access with non-admin users
- [ ] Ensure all tables have appropriate RLS policies

### Monitoring Setup (Platform Team)
- [ ] Configure alerts for 403 responses (admin guard blocks)
- [ ] Monitor health check endpoint availability
- [ ] Track unauthorized access attempts in logs

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] `/database-viewer` returns 410 Gone
- [ ] `/api/health` returns only `{ "status": "ok" }`
- [ ] Non-admin users receive 403 on `/api/admin/*` endpoints
- [ ] Admin users can access admin endpoints
- [ ] Security headers present in all responses
- [ ] Unauthenticated users redirected to signin on protected routes

## Rollback Plan

If issues arise:
1. Revert middleware.ts to previous version
2. Restore health endpoint with detailed info (temporarily)
3. Remove admin guard wrapper from affected endpoints
4. Keep database-viewer deleted (security critical)

## Next Steps

Proceed to Sprint P1: Decouple UI & Auth
- Split www vs app layouts
- Remove Supabase from marketing pages
- Isolate AuthProvider to app routes only
