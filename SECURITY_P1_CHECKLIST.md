# Sprint P1: Decouple UI & Auth - Completion Checklist

## Completed Items

### 1. Layout Separation
- [x] Created `app/(www)/layout.tsx` for marketing pages (no AuthProvider)
- [x] Created `app/(app)/layout.tsx` for authenticated app pages (with AuthProvider)
- [x] Removed root `app/layout.tsx` to enforce route group layouts

### 2. Marketing Pages (www) - No Supabase
- [x] Moved `/` to `/(www)/page.tsx`
- [x] Moved `/services` to `/(www)/services/page.tsx`
- [x] Moved `/a-propos` to `/(www)/a-propos/page.tsx`
- [x] Moved `/comment-ca-marche` to `/(www)/comment-ca-marche/page.tsx`
- [x] Added Header and Footer to all www pages

### 3. App Pages (app) - With Supabase Auth
- [x] Moved `/reservation` to `/(app)/reservation/page.tsx`
- [x] Moved `/dashboard` to `/(app)/dashboard/page.tsx`
- [x] Moved `/profile` to `/(app)/profile/page.tsx`
- [x] Moved `/bookings` to `/(app)/bookings/page.tsx`
- [x] Moved `/subscription/*` to `/(app)/subscription/*`
- [x] Moved `/admin/*` to `/(app)/admin/*`

### 4. Middleware Updates
- [x] Updated middleware to only check auth for app routes
- [x] Marketing pages (www) bypass Supabase auth checks
- [x] Maintained security headers for all routes

### 5. Cleanup
- [x] Removed `app/(main)` route group
- [x] Removed duplicate root layout

## Architecture Benefits

### Performance
- Marketing pages load faster (no Supabase client initialization)
- Reduced JavaScript bundle size for public pages
- Better SEO for marketing content (no auth overhead)

### Security
- Clear separation between public and authenticated routes
- AuthProvider only loads for authenticated users
- Reduced attack surface on marketing pages

### Maintainability
- Clear distinction between www (marketing) and app (authenticated)
- Easier to apply different layouts/styles to each section
- Simpler to add new marketing pages without auth concerns
