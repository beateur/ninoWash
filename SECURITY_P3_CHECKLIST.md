# Security Sprint P3 Checklist: Stripe & API

**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED  
**Date:** 2025-01-10  
**Sprint:** P3 - Stripe & API Security

---

## Overview

Sprint P3 focuses on moving Stripe checkout logic from Server Actions to API routes for better security, implementing server-only checkout flows, and adding rate limiting to payment endpoints.

---

## Objectives

- [x] Move Stripe checkout creation from Server Actions to API routes
- [x] Implement server-only checkout session retrieval
- [x] Add proper authentication checks to all payment endpoints
- [x] Deprecate old Server Action pattern
- [x] Add security logging for payment operations
- [x] Verify user ownership of checkout sessions

---

## Implementation Checklist

### 1. API Route Migration

- [x] Create `/api/checkout/create` route
  - [x] POST endpoint for creating checkout sessions
  - [x] Server-side authentication required
  - [x] Validates plan exists and is active
  - [x] Creates or retrieves Stripe customer
  - [x] Returns client secret for embedded checkout
  - [x] Logs session creation with user/plan IDs

- [x] Create `/api/checkout/session` route
  - [x] GET endpoint for retrieving session status
  - [x] Server-side authentication required
  - [x] Validates session belongs to authenticated user
  - [x] Returns sanitized session data only

- [x] Webhook route already exists at `/api/webhooks/stripe`
  - [x] Handles checkout.session.completed
  - [x] Handles subscription lifecycle events
  - [x] Handles invoice payment events
  - [x] Uses service role key for database writes

### 2. Client Component Updates

- [x] Update `components/subscription/checkout-form.tsx`
  - [x] Replace Server Action call with API fetch
  - [x] Use `/api/checkout/create` endpoint
  - [x] Proper error handling and display
  - [x] Maintains embedded checkout UI

### 3. Server Action Deprecation

- [x] Deprecate `app/actions/stripe.ts`
  - [x] Add deprecation warnings
  - [x] Throw errors directing to new API routes
  - [x] Keep file for backward compatibility
  - [x] Document migration path

### 4. Security Enhancements

- [x] Authentication on all payment endpoints
  - [x] `/api/checkout/create` requires valid session
  - [x] `/api/checkout/session` requires valid session
  - [x] Returns 401 for unauthenticated requests

- [x] Authorization checks
  - [x] Verify user owns the checkout session
  - [x] Returns 403 for unauthorized access
  - [x] Prevents session hijacking

- [x] Input validation
  - [x] Validate planId is provided
  - [x] Validate sessionId is provided
  - [x] Validate plan exists and is active
  - [x] Returns 400 for invalid inputs

- [x] Security logging
  - [x] Log checkout session creation
  - [x] Log session retrieval attempts
  - [x] Log authentication failures
  - [x] Include user ID and plan ID in logs

### 5. Webhook Security

- [x] Webhook signature verification
  - [x] Uses `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`
  - [x] Rejects requests with invalid signatures
  - [x] Returns 400 for signature failures

- [x] Idempotency
  - [x] Stripe handles webhook retries
  - [x] Database operations are idempotent
  - [x] Duplicate events don't cause issues

## Security Improvements

### API Routes vs Server Actions

**Why API Routes are More Secure:**

1. **Explicit Authentication**
   - API routes require explicit auth checks
   - Server Actions can be called from any client component
   - Harder to accidentally expose unauthenticated endpoints

2. **Rate Limiting**
   - API routes can be rate limited by path
   - Server Actions harder to rate limit individually
   - Prevents payment endpoint abuse

3. **CORS Control**
   - API routes have explicit CORS policies
   - Server Actions inherit Next.js defaults
   - Better control over cross-origin requests

4. **Logging & Monitoring**
   - API routes easier to monitor and log
   - Centralized error handling
   - Better observability for payment flows

5. **Separation of Concerns**
   - Clear boundary between client and server
   - Payment logic isolated from UI components
   - Easier to audit and secure

### Attack Surface Reduction

- ✅ No Server Actions exposed for payment operations
- ✅ All payment endpoints require authentication
- ✅ Session ownership verified before retrieval
- ✅ Webhook signature verification prevents spoofing
- ✅ Proper error messages don't leak sensitive data

## Testing Checklist

### Manual Testing

- [ ] Unauthenticated user calling `/api/checkout/create` → Returns 401
- [ ] Authenticated user with valid planId → Returns client secret
- [ ] Authenticated user with invalid planId → Returns 404
- [ ] User trying to retrieve another user's session → Returns 403
- [ ] Valid checkout session completion → Creates subscription in database
- [ ] Webhook with invalid signature → Returns 400
- [ ] Webhook with valid signature → Processes event successfully

### Integration Testing

- [ ] Complete checkout flow end-to-end
- [ ] Verify subscription created in database
- [ ] Verify Stripe customer created
- [ ] Verify webhook events processed
- [ ] Verify user can access subscription after payment

## Migration Guide

### For Developers

**Old Pattern (Deprecated):**
\`\`\`typescript
import { createCheckoutSession } from "@/app/actions/stripe"

const clientSecret = await createCheckoutSession(planId)
\`\`\`

**New Pattern (Recommended):**
\`\`\`typescript
const response = await fetch("/api/checkout/create", {
  method: "POST",
  headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
  body: JSON.stringify({ planId }),
})

const { clientSecret } = await response.json()
\`\`\`

---

## Performance Impact

- ✅ API routes have similar performance to Server Actions
- ✅ No additional network hops (both are server-side)
- ✅ Slightly better caching potential with API routes
- ✅ No negative impact on user experience

---

## Rollback Plan

If issues arise:

1. **Revert to Server Actions temporarily:**
   \`\`\`typescript
   // In checkout-form.tsx
   import { createCheckoutSession } from "@/app/actions/stripe"
   const clientSecret = await createCheckoutSession(planId)
   \`\`\`

2. **Keep API routes in place:**
   - Both patterns can coexist during migration
   - Gradually migrate users to new pattern

3. **Monitor error rates:**
   - Watch for 401/403 errors indicating auth issues
   - Check Stripe dashboard for failed sessions

---

## Documentation Updates

- [x] Create `SECURITY_P3_CHECKLIST.md`
- [x] Document new API routes
- [x] Add migration guide for developers
- [x] Update architecture documentation

---

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] All Stripe checkout operations use API routes
- [x] No Server Actions used for payment operations
- [x] All payment endpoints require authentication
- [x] Session ownership verified before retrieval
- [x] Webhook signature verification in place
- [x] Security logging for all payment operations
- [x] Proper error handling and user feedback

---

## Next Steps (Sprint P4)

- Implement strict CORS policies
- Add HttpOnly cookies for session management
- Implement Backend-for-Frontend (BFF) pattern
- Add rate limiting to all API routes
- Implement request signing for sensitive operations
